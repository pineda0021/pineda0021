 üî≠ Our Mathematics Department is currently working on **a Statistical Data Analytics Certificate/Program**

This program not only prepares students to develop predictive models, evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions and strategies, and mitigate risks and anomalies in data, but also equips students with practical skills in data visualization and experience using programming tools such as Python and R. Students will acquire the skills to communicate complex statistical information to a variety of stakeholders effectively, and ultimately, to equip students for success in the data-driven world.

Our Certificate under the Mathematics Department consists of only 19 units for completion.

**Fall - Year One:**

- Math 217 - Fundamentals of Mathematical Programming (4 units; UC/CSU)
  
  **Fall 2024 Course Offering:**
  
  The Mathematics Department is pleased to offer the following course:
  
  **MATH 217**
  - **Schedule:** Monday/Wednesday, 6:50 PM - 9:15 PM  
  - **Format:** Synchronous, via Zoom  
  - **Section Number:** 25437

- Math 229 - Statistics for Data Science (4 units; UC/CSU)
  
  **Fall 2024 Course Offering:**
  
  The Mathematics Department is pleased to offer the following course:

‚ö° Fun fact: **The Aztecs developed a sophisticated number system that used dots (‚Ä¢) to represent 1, bars (‚Äî) to represent 5, and a symbol resembling a flag for 20. This vigesimal (base-20) system allowed them to perform complex mathematical calculations and keep accurate records for trade, astronomy, and engineering projects.**
